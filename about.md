For those of you who don't know me, I'm a rather idealistic individual (for better or for worse).

I'm very optimistic about the future of humanity, and I prefer to take a utilitarian approach to problems.

I want to **1.) live a fulfilling life** and **2.) make the world a better place**. However, if I had to pick one, I would pick the latter.

I recently became especially interested in advancing healthcare technology. I'm excited to see what the future holds. 

I enjoy reading, meeting people of diverse backgrounds, traveling off the beaten path, and dishing out copious amounts of completely unsolicited life advice. 

Questions? Email me (below), and I'll always get back to you.
