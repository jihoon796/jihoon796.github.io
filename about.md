I'm a rather idealistic individual (for better or for worse, we will see).

I'm very optimistic about the future of humanity, and I tend to take a utilitarian approach to problems.

I want to: <br>
**1.) live a fulfilling life without being selfish** <br>
**2.) make the world a better place without being cliché**. <br>
If I had to pick one, I would pick the latter.

I enjoy reading, meeting people of diverse backgrounds, having my beliefs challenged, and dishing out copious amounts of unsolicited life advice. 

Any thoughts? Email me (below), and I'll get back to you.
