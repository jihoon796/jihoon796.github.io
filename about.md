I'm a rather idealistic individual (for better or for worse, we will see).

I'm very optimistic about the future of humanity, and I tend to take a utilitarian approach to problems.

Like most people, I want to **1.) live a fulfilling life** and **2.) make the world a better place**. However, if I had to pick one, I would pick the latter.

I enjoy reading, meeting people of diverse backgrounds, traveling off the beaten path, and dishing out copious amounts of completely unsolicited life advice. 

Any thoughts? Email me (below), and I'll always get back to you.
