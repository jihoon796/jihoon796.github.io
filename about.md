I'm a rather idealistic individual (for better or for worse, we will see).

I'm very optimistic about the future of humanity, and I tend to take a utilitarian approach to problems.

I want to: <br>
**1.) live a fulfilling life without being selfish** <br>
**2.) make the world a better place without being clich√©**. <br>
If I had to pick one, I would pick the latter.

I enjoy reading, meeting people of diverse backgrounds, having my beliefs challenged, and giving out unsolicited life advice. 

Any thoughts? Email me (below), and I'll get back to you.
