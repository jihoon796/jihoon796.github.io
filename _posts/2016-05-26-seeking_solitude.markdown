Here is a contrarian (and possibly controversial) statement: spend less time with family and friends and more time alone.

Let's take a step back and examine the pseudo-sociology/quackery that led me to this conclusion. For any given social group, there are patterns of behavior that define that group. These behavioral patterns are shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic forces, and the stronger the forces, the tighter-knit the group tends to be. Over time, these patterns become organizational habits that more or less become set in stone, only disrupted by significant exogenous shocks. In a social group, each individual plays a specific role and influences the “culture” of the group - and in return, each individual is also significantly influenced by the group itself. For example, an individual might subconsciously pick up new speech patterns or behavioral mannerism/tics that aren’t characteristic of that person. And in return, the more time a person spends in a social group, the more influence the group exerts on them. I suspect a logarithmic relationship between time and social influence.

The potential problem with all of this stems from the fact that many of us spend a very large portion of our day being surrounded by people exerting all sorts of social influence on us - both at work and at home. Although time spent with family and friends should be cherished, it is nevertheless a fact that we are often neck-deep in external stimuli and social influence. And whether it’s through decision fatigue or the innate human desire to conform, it seems like the more social influence we receive from others, the less conscientious we tend to become. Hence, the proverbial “drinking of the kool-aid”, the "herd mentality", the "lemming effect", etc.

So what? Well, a lack of conscientiousness is generally unproductive and can even be outright dangerous. It’s incredibly easy to get caught up by social influence without even realizing it - just ask any angsty middle school teenager. Members of either populations are probably not of the conscientious type. I also have moments when I get caught up in the social circles that I’m a part of. As the saying goes, "you are the average of your five best friends”, and I find that I am no different.

But it turns out that you don’t have to meditate every morning or go on an occasional weekend bender to become more self-aware (to each their own) - one of the easiest ways to cultivate independent thinking is simply to spend more time alone. And I don’t mean alone as in binge-watching Netflix or playing video games alone in your room. To be truly alone means allowing yourself to delve into your deepest and perhaps darkest thoughts. You are allowing yourself to be vulnerable…to you.

It seems like many people today place a lot of value on being “connected” with friends and family at all times - to the point where being truly alone for a long time is seen as “antisocial”. But that’s precisely why my advice goes against the grain - it’d be waste of time to write about something that everyone talks about. So put that kool-aid down, spend some quality time alone, and listen to your inner voice - and maybe it will make you happier and your life more enriching.
