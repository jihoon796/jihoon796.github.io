>"People tend to over-weigh risks on a personal level. It's one thing if you've got a mortgage to pay and kids to support, so that if you were to deviate from your job, well, how are you going to feed your family and pay the rent? That's understandable, but let's say you're young and you're just coming out of college, what are your risks? You're not going to starve, certainly not in any kind of modern economy. It's so easy to earn enough money just to live somewhere and eat food. Very easy to do. So I don't know what they're afraid of. Mostly afraid of failure, I think, but people should be less risk averse, when there's not much at risk." - Elon Musk 


All humans are, to some degree, predisposed to laziness. This means that we tend to follow the path of least resistance, at least in the short run. This also means that we have a natural tendency to settle in our lives. I'm not talking about "settling" in terms of always striving for perfection (on the contrary, the endless chase for perfection can leave many people unhappy and disillusioned, since not everyone can be the best at any given pursuit, by definition). What I'm referring to is a kind of complacency where you fail to do the things that will make you happiest in the long run. Of course, everyone has problems that seem to stand resolutely in the way - for example, it seems like even the great Elon Musk forgot about the existence of student loans - but at the end of the day, *most* of these problems are just exogenous variables that don't define you as a human being. There are few personal constraints that can truly stop you from doing what makes you happiest in the long run, assuming you know what will make you happy. I won't get into a debate about determinism vs. free will, but you should get my point either way. 

I've boiled down the aforementioned personal constraints to just three: *1.) inability, 2.) apathy, and 3.) fear.*

We will ignore the first facet, *inability*, because some of us are in unfortunate situations where happiness is simply unobtainable. For most people, however, this is not the case. 

The second one, *apathy*, is closely related to laziness. But I'm not referring to the conventional notion of laziness here; I've seen some very hard-working people who grind through daily routines like a machine, yet they lack the mental diligence to ask the difficult questions required in order to find what makes them happy and embrace it. Granted, I think previous generations did not have access to this luxury, since life for them was more of a matter of survival rather than finding happiness/enjoyment. But with the passage of time, that has certainly changed. It is no longer very difficult to just survive as long as you're born in the right socioeconomic environment and have an education. 

The last and possibly the most significant constraint is *fear*. Fear of the unknown. Fear of breaking the status quo. Fear of challenging preconceived notions and thinking from first principles, rather than from presumed truths. This is also the part that I myself am the most guilty of. But what's there to be so afraid of, may I ask? The truth is, the vast majority of our fears are actually thinly-disguised first-world problems. In reality, we fear losing our social reputation. We fear losing our Netflix account. We fear not being able to buy the newest iPhone. 

I'm not advocating that everyone should quit whatever they're doing and eschew all material possessions. I just want to show you a different way of thinking. 

In my opinion, the biggest risk in life is to regret not doing the things you've wanted to do. Don't be afraid to be unequivocally yourself, and do things that will make you happy. As Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself".
