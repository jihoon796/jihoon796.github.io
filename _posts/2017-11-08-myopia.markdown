Myopia means “nearsightedness”, and it’s a word that’s been on my mind for a while. 

It’s been a few months since I moved to San Francisco from Durham. Since then, I’ve fallen in love with the city and the surrounding Bay Area as a whole. The nature here is breathtaking, the food options are amazing, the people are diverse and enterprising, I could go on all day...

Although SF isn’t necessarily a huge city (in terms of both land area and population), it is most certainly a cultural behemoth. In the US, it may be the most culturally relevant city outside of New York City and Los Angeles. One is able to fully immerse themselves in any niche or lifestyle one chooses. And it doesn’t matter how unique you believe yourself to be - there is a probably a community of people just like you. 

Despite not taking any of these things for granted, I do have to admit that SF is an extremely polarizing place. There are facets to living here that have made me take a long hard look at myself and my surrounding environment. Sure, my observations can be extrapolated to any other major metropolitan area in the US - but at the same time, they are probably more relevant to the Bay Area than to other places. Out of all of the observations that I've made, one concept has always stuck out in particular to me: 

<b>SF is out of touch with reality. </b>
Everyone knows the problems that SF faces - lack of good public transportation (BART, Caltrain, and the Muni systems cannot be considered "good" public transportation by any means), homelessness/drug abuse, rampant property theft, extreme income disparity<sup>2</sup>, and so on. Like many others, I often wonder about how to solve these problems, and of course, there are no easy answers (although some people claim that there are). I believe that barring extreme income disparity<sup>1</sup>, the other problems I've mentioned can actually be solved.

I recently came back from a trip to Korea and Japan, and one of the most striking things I noticed was the lack of homeless people and petty crime in the streets. What do these places have that the SF Bay Area doesn't? Why haven't 


We can change some of the variables in the homelessness equation, but I believe that real change is not yet on the horizon. 

- Gini coefficient is on par with Rwanda (http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Income-inequality-on-par-with-developing-nations-5486434.php)
- Bay Area politics is a constant struggle between the entrenched incumbents vs. the newcomers who often leave after a few years
- NIMBY-ism, related to incumbents
- Supply and demand --> distortion of supply through Bay Area politics
- American culture as one of individualism and diversity, rather than collectivism and unity
- Perhaps a matter of cultural preference...American dream? But look at NYC as a counter-example

Notes: 

1. The Gini coefficient is one measure of income inequality. SF is, hilariously, on par with Rwanda (http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Income-inequality-on-par-with-developing-nations-5486434.php)
2. Some may argue that extreme income disparity is not a problem, that that is the natural Darwinian order of the world. It is my opinion that <i>extreme</i> income disparity carries externalities (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative) that are sufficiently negative to where the most appropriate the most appropriate course of action is to intervene. However, in order to really fix the disparity issue, we would need to reform the entire US tax code to be more progressive and implement a Universal Basic Income program to redistribute wealth efficiently. The goal here is not to create a socialist utopia where no one has any incentive to work (that has been attempted before, albeit unsuccessfully), but to create a safety net to catch people if they fall. Unfortunately, many destitute Americans would rather see themselves as "temporarily embarrased millionaires" and blindly choose follow the dogma of the American Dream.
