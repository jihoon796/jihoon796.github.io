Myopia means “nearsightedness”, and it’s a word that’s been on my mind for a while. 

It’s been a few months since I moved to San Francisco from Durham. Since then, I’ve fallen in love with the city and the surrounding Bay Area as a whole. The nature here is breathtaking, the food is amazing, the people are diverse and enterprising, I could go on all day...

Despite not taking any of these things for granted, I do have to admit that San Francisco is an extremely polarizing place. There are certainly negative facets to living here that have convinced me to take a long hard look at myself and my surrounding environment. Of course, to some degree, my observations can be extrapolated to any major city in the US - but I believe that they do hold true for the Bay Area more than anywhere else. 

One such observation that I made was that there’s a niche for anyone. Although San Francisco isn’t a huge city (in terms of both land area and population), one is able to fully immerse themselves in any culture or subculture they choose. There’s truly something here for everyone. It doesn’t matter how unique you think you are - there’s someone just like you. For example, while I was living in NC, I was somewhat of a “minimalist” when it came to clothing. I bought 10 or so v-neck shirts that were black, gray, and heather gray, and that became my de facto outfit for the next year. Soon after moving to SF, I attended a party, and I met 4 Asian-American males who were all wearing black v-neck shirts emphatically nodding to each other about the virtues of minimalism.

Anyways, the problem with this is that it is easy to find yourself inside of an echo chamber, impervious to what’s actually going on in the rest of the world. Even when the outside world is looking you right in the face, there is a sufficient population of “weird people” here that you typically get desensitized to some degree. For example, the homeless problem is extreme in SF - but after a few months here, I found myself desensitized to seeing people sleeping and shooting up on the streets.
