Myopia means “nearsightedness”, and it’s a word that’s been on my mind for a while. 

It’s been a few months since I moved to San Francisco from Durham. Since then, I’ve fallen in love with the city and the surrounding Bay Area as a whole. The nature here is breathtaking, the food is amazing, the people are diverse and enterprising, I could go on all day...

Despite not taking any of these things for granted, I do have to admit that San Francisco is an extremely polarizing place. There are certainly facets to living here that have convinced me to take a long hard look at myself and my surrounding environment. Of course, to some degree, my observations can be extrapolated to any major city in the US - but in some ways, they are also unique to the Bay Area itself. 

One such observation that I want to expand upon is that there’s a niche for everyone. Although San Francisco isn’t necessarily a huge city (in terms of both land area and population), it is certainly a cultural giant. One is able to fully immerse themselves in any niche or lifestyle they choose. There’s truly something here for everyone. It doesn’t matter how unique you believe yourself to be - there is a community of people just like you. 

The problem with this is that it is easy to find yourself inside of an echo chamber, impervious to what’s actually going on in the rest of the world. Even when the outside world is looking you right in the face, there is a sufficient population of “weird people” here that you typically get desensitized to some degree. For example, the homeless problem is extreme in SF - but after a few months here, I found myself desensitized to seeing people sleeping and shooting up on the streets. 


I recently came back from a trip to Korea and Japan. One of the most striking things I noticed was the impressive infrastucture and public planning. Of course, there's no place that is perfect,
