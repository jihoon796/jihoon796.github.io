Myopia means “nearsightedness”, and it’s a word that’s been on my mind for a while. 

It’s been a few months since I moved to San Francisco from Durham. Since then, I’ve fallen in love with the city and the surrounding Bay Area as a whole. The nature here is breathtaking, the food options are amazing, the people are diverse and enterprising, I could go on all day...

Although SF isn’t necessarily a huge city (in terms of both land area and population), it is most certainly a cultural behemoth. In the US, it may be the most culturally relevant city outside of New York City and Los Angeles. One is able to fully immerse themselves in any niche or lifestyle they choose. And it doesn’t matter how unique you believe yourself to be - there is a probably a community of people just like you. 

Despite not taking any of these things for granted, I do have to admit that SF is an extremely polarizing place. There are facets to living here that have made me take a long hard look at myself and my surrounding environment. To some degree, my observations can be extrapolated to any major metropolitan region in the US - but at the same time, they are probably more relevant to the Bay Area than to other places. 

1. Extreme homelessness & rampant drug abuse 
Everyone knows about this. I've often wondered about how to solve this problem, and of course, there are no easy answers (although some people claim that there are). I recently came back from a trip to Korea and Japan, and one of the most striking things I noticed was the lack of homelessness and the lack of extreme drug usage in the streets. 

- Gini coefficient is on par with Rwanda (http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Income-inequality-on-par-with-developing-nations-5486434.php)
- Bay Area politics is a constant struggle between the entrenched incumbents vs. the newcomers 
- NIMBY-ism, related to incumbents
- Supply and demand --> distortion of supply through Bay Area politics
- American culture as one of individualism and diversity, rather than collectivism and unity
