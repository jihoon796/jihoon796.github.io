<br>
"Farsighted" is a word that’s been on my mind for a while. 

It’s been a few months since I moved to CA from NC. Since then, I’ve fallen in love with SF and the surrounding Bay Area as a whole. The nature here is breathtaking, the food options are amazing, the people are diverse and enterprising...do I really need to go on?

Although SF isn’t necessarily a huge city (in terms of both land area and population), it is most certainly a cultural behemoth. It may be the most culturally relevant city in the US outside of New York City and Los Angeles. As such, one is able to fully immerse themselves in any niche or lifestyle one chooses. And it doesn’t matter how unique you believe yourself to be - there is a probably a community of people just like you. 

Despite my professed love for the city, I do have to admit that this place is far from perfect. There are certain facets to living here that have made me scratch my head and think twice. One thought in particular has been creeping up on me lately, a whisper I hear in my head occasionally: 

<b>SF is out of touch with reality. </b>

Everyone knows the problems that SF faces as a city: a lack of good public infrastructure, homelessness/drug abuse, rampant property theft, the crazy cost of living (mostly due to rent), extreme income disparity<sup>1</sup>, and so on. Why is the city out of touch? First of all, it's very easy here to live in a bubble and be sheltered from all of the problems that the city actually faces. It especially pains me to see how idealistic some people are ("cryptocurrencies will revolutionize the world", "we need to get to Mars ASAP"), and it seems like they are farsighted: able to see great distances into the future, but unable/unwilling to see imminent issues right in front of their eyes. 

Gather a critical mass of these people, and then you have Silicon Valley: slaving away on "innovative" ideas like Juicero and Snapchat<sup>2</sup> (dog filters, anyone?) and claiming to make the world a better place, but failing to see some of the immediate societal problems. And no, I don't necessarily blame these people: this is perhaps a shortcoming of the hyper-capitalist society which we live in today - it optimizes for the wrong output ($$) - but at the same time, I wonder if there's more to it than just blaming the system. 

And of course, not everyone here is like that. There are plenty of people here who do care about the aforementioned problems. The disappointment that I have is with its proportional mindshare <i>relative</i> to the other things people are working on here. 

<b>How do we solve these issues? </b>

Like many others, I've often wondered about how to solve some of these issues. Some of the people I've talked to - notably engineers - like to take a somewhat patronizing approach to problem-solving, as if these problems could be "disrupted" away during a weekend hackathon. Others who have lived here long enough have simply become jaded to many of these issues, as there realistically isn't much that a single individual can do to fix them...or so I've heard.

I'm not going to propose any answers myself. I simply don't have them. But what I am going to do is make an appeal to idealism. I ask you to see the world for what it is - a rat race indeed, but one where you can decide which course to take. <br><br>

Notes: 

1. The Gini coefficient is one measure of income inequality. SF's Gini coefficient is (hilariously) on par with <a href='http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Income-inequality-on-par-with-developing-nations-5486434.php'>Rwanda</a>. Although it is my opinion that <i>extreme</i> income disparity carries <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative'>externalities</a> that are negative to the point where it is necessary to intervene, really fixing this issue in any major city would require a nationwide cultural shift. This probably will not happen for a very long time, as many destitute Americans see themselves as "temporarily embarrased millionaires" rather than for who they really are.
2. <a href='https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing'>Here's a link to an article written about Juicero</a>. Also, Snapchat is based in Venice, but the point still stands.
3. I realize that I'm somewhat of a hypocrite, as I currently work as an engineer at a financial technology company. But I'm interested in healthcare and working on transitioning out of finance altogether. 
4. Major factors which contribute to SF's problems:<br>
- Bay Area politics is a constant struggle between the entrenched incumbents vs. the newcomers who often leave after a few years. NIMBY-ism is closely related to the incumbent population, and the supply (and therefore price) of real estate is heavily distorted by it. <br>
- American culture is one of individualism and diversity, rather than collectivism and unity. Although I do believe in the value of political, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, I also believe that this accounts for many of the political failures of the US, on every level of government. <br>
