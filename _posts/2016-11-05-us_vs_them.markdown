>"Politics is supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."
— Ronald Reagan

American politics seems to be ever-polarizing, especially with the current debacle of an election cycle. It seems that this time around, the political pendulum will swing towards one extreme instead of being at a point of relative equilibrium.

I noticed recently that there are many armchair politicans who have strong, almost unwavering viewpoints. They publicize their political opinions every chance they get, whether it’s on social media, at work, at social events, etc. Something that’s bothered me a lot is how critical they are of others who disagree with their opinions. Perhaps it’s human nature to take sides and be quick to judgement, but surely there are ways to strongly consider other opinions without it always devolving into a “us vs. them” standoff?

The problem is that many people see political ideologies as a "package deal", rather than something that is "a la carte". They instinctively gravitate towards opinions based on their own political affililations and don’t necessarily give individual viewpoints much thought on a granular level (if they did, many would change their minds - the devil’s always in the details). This, among a slew of other factors, leads to massive amounts of confirmation bias, since we’re generally surrounded by people who are similar to us anyways. Due to the self-selection of our social circles, our political viewpoints get somewhat magnified as the people similar to us get spurred on and the few who dare to be contrarians receive indignant responses from unempathetic minds.

This is where the issue of political correctness comes in. We often use political correctness as a blanket to cover up our underlying emotions - "oh you can’t say [insert statement here] because that’s racist/sexist/etc".<sup>1</sup>  Instead of communicating our truest thoughts, we hide them under the pretense of political correctness and the illusion of social harmony. As a result, people of different racial/socioeconomic backgrounds: <i>a.) don’t feel comfortable with each other, b.) don’t communicate, and c.) can’t see things from other people’s point-of-view. </i>Sometimes, the societal tension builds up so much you can literally feel it in the air. This means that when times do get heated, instead of collectively working together to identify the root causes of our social issues, we end up resorting to name-calling and using derogatory remarks, which separates us even further because now our feelings are hurt and we’re feeling defensive.

The point I’m trying to make is simple: <b>you will never change someone else's mind when arguing about politics. So say what you want to say freely, but give others the opportunity to talk about their opinions freely as well.</b>

It’s never "us vs. them” - like it or not, we all live in the same country together. Let us embrace the diversity of opinions in our country and let us not become so self-centered as to think that we always know what’s best for everyone else around us.

Notes: 

1. Of course, this doesn't mean you should say inflammatory statements just to bait a negative reaction. That's counterproductive.

2. Part of the blame is the education system in America. Depending on where you’re from, schools don’t do a great job teaching students to think critically about politics. Perhaps they push Adam Smith and American exceptionalism too hard. But it’s damn hard to teach correctly, so I don’t necessarily blame teachers. I think teachers are vastly underpaid/underappreciated in America, but that’s another issue.
