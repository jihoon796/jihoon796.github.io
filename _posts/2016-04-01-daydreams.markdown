When you daydream, what is it usually about? You probably have a small collection of thoughts which your mind returns to regularly or whenever you get a lull in activity.  

Let's go further. When you wake up in the morning and open your eyes, what is the first real conscious thought that crosses your mind? What about on your drive to work, while you're waiting in line at Starbucks, while you're at the gym, while you're taking a shower, while you're watching TV? Are you thinking about that new coat you've been wanting to buy, or is it that new restaurant you've been wanting to try for the longest time? 

Take careful note of what those thoughts are - then ask yourself, "do these thoughts represent the values that I want to live my life by"? The first thing on your mind is a representation of your subconscious; if your first thoughts are what you want to/should be thinking about, then great. However, if your subconscious is preoccupied by thoughts that aren't really that important to you, then you clearly aren't spending enough time thinking about what is. It may be time to reevaluate and reconsider where, how, and why you're doing the things you do every day. 

The point that I'm trying to make is that we should always be thinking about the thoughts that surround us, for being aware of these meta-thoughts leads to conscientiousness, which is absolutely essential for self-improvement. That's why I made it the title of my website, to constantly remind myself to be aware of my own thoughts and look for ways for self-improvement.
